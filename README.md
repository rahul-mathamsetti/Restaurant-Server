# Restaurant Server
Built a full stack web application that allows users to order food, add and remove comments and ratings for each dish,
and reserve tables at a restaurant. The application uses the Mongoose ORM to connect to a MongoDB database, which is used to store information about
the restaurant, its location, and customer feedback. It uses NodeJS as the backend server and Bootstrap for the frontend design, providing a user-friendly interface for
customers to interact with the restaurantâ€™s services
